=== Automatic support from frameworks

Most frameworks now have default support for preventing CSRF. For example with Angular an interceptor reads a token
from a cookie by default XSRF-TOKEN and sets it as an HTTP header, X-XSRF-TOKEN. Since only code that runs on your domain
could read the cookie, the backend can be certain that the HTTP request came from your client application and not an attacker.

In order for this to work the backend server sets the token in a cookie. As the value of the cookie should be read
by Angular (JavaScript) this cookie should not be marked with the http-only flag. On every request towards the server
Angular will put the token in the X-XSRF-TOKEN as a HTTP header. The server can validate whether those two tokens
match and this will ensure the server the request is running on the same domain.

*Important: DEFINE A SEPARATE COOKIE, DO NOT REUSE THE SESSION COOKIE*

Remember the session cookie should always be defined with http-only flag.

Another effective defense can be to add a custom request header to each call. This will work if all the interactions
with the server are performed with JavaScript. On the server side you only need to check the presence of this header
if this header is not present deny the request.

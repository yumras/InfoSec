# XSS success, failure messages and hints
xss-reflected-5a-success=well done, but alerts aren't very impressive are they? Please continue.
xss-reflected-5a-failure=Try again. We do want to see this specific javascript (in case you are trying to do something more fancy)
xss-reflected-5b-success=Correct ... because <ul><li>The script was not triggered by the URL/QueryString</li><li>Even if you use the attack URL in a new tab, it won't execute (becuase of response type). Try it if you like.</li></ul>
xss-reflected-5b-failure=Nope, pretty easy to guess now though.
xss-reflected-6a-success=Correct! Now, see if you can send in an exploit to that route in the next assignment.
xss-reflected-6a-failure=No, look at the example. Check the GoatRouter.js file. It should be pretty easy to determine.
xss.lesson1.failure=Are you sure? Try using a tab from a different site.
xss-dom-message-success=Correct, I hope you didn't cheat, using the console!
xss-dom-message-failure=Incorrect, keep trying. It should be obvious in the log when you are successful.
xss-stored-comment-success=It appears your payload should invoke the function. To tell for sure, you need to capture the value and put it in the form below. Then we will really know.
xss-stored-comment-failure=We can't see the payload in your submission, but XSS can be tricky. Look for the call back fired after the comments reload. If you see that and can put the correct value there and put it in, maybe you did succeed.
xss-stored-callback-success=Yes, that is the correct value (note, it will be a different value each time the phoneHome endpoint is called).
xss-stored-callback-failure=No, that is not the correct value (note, it will be a different value each time the phoneHome endpoint is called).

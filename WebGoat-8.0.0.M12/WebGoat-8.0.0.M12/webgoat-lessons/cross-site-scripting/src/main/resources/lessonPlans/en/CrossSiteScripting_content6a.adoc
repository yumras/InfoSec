== Ientify Potential for DOM-Based XSS

DOM-Based XSS can usually be found by looking for the route configurations in the client-side code.
Look for a route that takes inputs that you can ID being 'reflected' to the page.

For this example, you'll want to look for some 'test' code in the route handlers (WebGoat uses backbone as its primary javascript library).
Sometimes, test code gets left in production (and often times test code is very simple and lacks security or any quality controls!).

Your objective is to find the route and exploit it. First though ... what is the base route? As an example, look at the URL for this lesson ...
it should look something like /WebGoat/start.mvc#lesson/CrossSiteScripting.lesson/5 (although maybe slightly different). The 'base route' in this case is:
*start.mvc#lesson/*

The *CrossSiteScripting.lesson/#* after that are parameters that are processed by javascript route handler.

So, what is test route for this test code?

== HTTPOnly  

* Disallows access to cookie in most modern browsers
** Even by the website that set the cookie in the first place 

* HTTPOnly Cookies are still accessible through AJAX
** This is accomplished using the XmlHttpRequest object
** Cookie data can still be read from the headers

* Public web sites that support multiple browsers
* Use a client-side script to determine the browser version for a visitor
* The website can restrict sensitive information to visitors using browsers that mitigate cross site scripting attacks for cookies
* Visitors with browsers that do not support HTTPOnly cookies can be given limited information or functionality along with a request to upgrade their software

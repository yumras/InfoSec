=== Use the intercept

To intercept a request, you start by clicking the green button. This will set a break point for the next request.

*NOTE*: It is also possible set breakpoints that are triggered on conditions. That won't be covered in this lesson though. You are encouraged to explore.
That's part of what hackers do ... explore!

Once you are intercepting requests and a request is made, it should look something like this:

=== Intercept and modify a request

Set up the intercept as noted above and then submit the form/request below by clicking the submit button. When you request is intercepted (hits the breakpoint),
modify it as follows.

* Change the Method to GET
* Add a header 'x-request-intercepted:true'
* Change the input value 'changeMe' to 'Requests are tampered easily' (without the single quotes)

Then let the request continue through (by hitting the play button).

NOTE: The two play buttons behave a little differently, but we'll let you tinker and figure that out for yourself.

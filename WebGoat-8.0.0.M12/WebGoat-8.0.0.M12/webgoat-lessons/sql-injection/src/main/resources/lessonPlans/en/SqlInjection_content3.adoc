== Consequences of SQL Injection

=== SQL injection attacks allow attackers to 
* Spoof identity
* Tamper with existing data
* Cause repudiation issues such as voiding transactions or changing balances
* Allow the complete disclosure of all data on the system
* Destroy the data or make it otherwise unavailable
* Become administrator of the database server 

=== SQL Injection is more common in PHP, Classic ASP, Cold Fusion and older languages
* Languages that do not provide parameterized query support
* Parameterized queries have been added to newer versions
* Early adopters of web technology (i.e. Old Code)
